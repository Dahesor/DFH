# DFH - Dahesor's Fake HUD

DFH is a library that **draws player's HUD** (Health bar and Armor bar) **with actionbar**, and has the option to use a scoreboard based **virtual health** system **while still listening to vanilla hp inputs** (mob attacks, fall damage, effect heals, etc.), so data pack is allowed to modify player health with scoreboard commands and make arbitrty changes to vanilla signals before they take effects.
